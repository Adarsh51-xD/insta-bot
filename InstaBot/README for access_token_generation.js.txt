The YOUR_REDIRECT_URI is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that you define when setting up your Instagram application in the Instagram Developer Console. It is used as part of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to redirect the user back to your application after they have granted or denied permission.

When you create an application on the Instagram Developer Console, you'll specify one or more redirect URIs. These URIs must match the URI you provide in your authorization request.

Here are the steps to set up the redirect URI:

Create a New Application on Instagram Developer Console:

Log in to the Instagram Developer Console, go to the "Manage Clients" section, and create a new application.
Configure Your Application:

In the application settings, there should be a section where you can specify the redirect URI(s). Add the URI(s) where you want Instagram to redirect users after they grant or deny permission.
Specify Redirect URI in Authorization Request:

In your authorization request (the URL where users are sent to log in and grant permission), include the same redirect URI. This is done with the redirect_uri parameter in the authorization URL.
