ACCESS TOKEN GENERATION USING OAUTH 2.0

1. Create an Instagram Developer Account:

If you don't have an Instagram Developer account, you'll need to create one. Go to the Instagram Developer website, log in with your Instagram account, and follow the instructions to set up a developer account.
Create a New Application:

Once you have a developer account, log in to the Instagram Developer Console. Create a new application to obtain client ID and client secret.


2. Configure Your Application: (NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE BOT SCRIPT EXECUTION)

Configure your application settings, including redirect URIs. Instagram uses redirect URIs to send the user back to your application after they grant permissions.


3. Obtain Client ID and Client Secret:

After creating your application, you'll get a client ID and client secret. Keep these credentials secure, and never expose them in public.


4. Set Up the Authorization URL:

Construct an authorization URL that includes your client ID, redirect URI, and the desired scope (permissions).
Example Authorization URL:

https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize
?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
&scope=user_profile,user_media
&response_type=code

Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_REDIRECT_URI with your actual client ID and redirect URI.


5. User Authorization:

Direct users (you in this case) to the authorization URL. They will be prompted to log in and grant permissions to your application.


6. Get Authorization Code:

After the user grants permission, Instagram will redirect them to your specified redirect URI with an authorization code as a query parameter.


7. Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token:

Use the obtained authorization code to make a POST request to the Instagram token endpoint to exchange it for an access token.
Example Token Request:

POST https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
&grant_type=authorization_code
&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET, YOUR_REDIRECT_URI, and AUTHORIZATION_CODE with your actual credentials and the obtained authorization code.




8. Receive Access Token:

The response to the token request will include the access token, which you can use to make authenticated requests to the Instagram API.
Once you have the access token, use it in your JavaScript code when making requests to the Instagram API.
